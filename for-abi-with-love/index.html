        <h1>Dear Abigdail,</h1>

        <p><span>I</span> hope this gift arrives well and on time to Albany. I have so much memories from there, the
            iceacreams in
            the
            entrance of Middleburgh to the swimming pool with Stella or the travel to Washington. A lot of water flowed
            under the bridge (a spanish expresison to say that a lot of things (the water) passed(!) since then (the
            bridge)) and now you are building a new bridge! I didn't ask too much about your partner, but knowing you,
            I'm
            sure it will be a sweet alliance with sincere(!) love.</p>

        <p><span>R</span>ecently I saw a picture of your father Wes, looking(!) at you on your future weeding dress,
            (invevitablemente)
            droping a tear. It's very beautiful to see that this (aconcimiento) will make Annette and Wes so happy and
            proud
            of you. As I am. I think we are around the same age but you are already dealing with the next step in life,
            setting(!) the pilars to build a family, so special. I hope you will have a very nice time during this
            weeding,
            meanwhile(!) we think about the ones who are not with us anymore but would wish the same, and that this
            togetherness will last and be filled of love as your parents are doing.</p>

        <p><span>A</span>bout the shinny orange box. It comes from Mosel, a store in Bilbao where my parents bought over
            the years
            beautiful objects for our house. I found this object(!) very expressive and playfull, two qualities that I
            enjoy
            (que je chérit), and that I also wish your alliance to have. Enjoy assembling it, here a picture <img
                 style="height: 20px; display: inline; width: auto; background-color: gray; border-radius: 6px;  cursor: pointer;"
                 src="calder.webp" onclick="fullscreen()" id="calder"
                 alt="">, and hoping that it will find a nice spot somewhere next to you Abi.
        </p>

        <p><span>I</span>'m finishing this lines in the airport waiting for my flight back to Amsterdam. A lot of hugs,
            luck and
            passion(!) for the next hundred years.</p>
