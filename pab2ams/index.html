        Pablo is a just graduated spanish + french guy who start in september an internship in Amsterdam. He will do
        design and websites and want to find cool people to live with. He's very polite and curious,
        engaged and open-minded. Ready for aventures, he eats everything and really like to do things. Responsible
        from a long date (boarding school at 13 - ouch), loving breakfast, he can share his french, spanish
        and english! He need to move for 6 months (but can be less if he moves) from this september to the next
        march. He's twenty-six years old, not here @sagesseastrale23.<br><br>Thanks !
