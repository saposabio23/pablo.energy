            <h1>5 february 2023</h1>
            <p>Some days I feel a bit lost. I don't know what it makes that, but I doub about what task I have to start, I put myself on something and movequickly to another task, but never done it right. It's like a wasted day.
            It happend time by time, maybe when I left my routine. I like the routine because you don't have to thing what to do, you only have to do it. TodayI went riding near the river, looking at the beautiful things , watching and letting the time past. Tomorrow will be a new day of choices.
            </p>
            <p>I'm thinking about buying some <i>perfume</i>.</p>
            <p>I start to writte a letter to my friend Daniel too.</p>
