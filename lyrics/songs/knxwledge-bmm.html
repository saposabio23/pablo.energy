                <span>[Intro: Eugene McDaniels]</span>
                Blunt full of that Buddha
                Car full of them shooters
                Bad chick from Bermuda
                But my Brazilian girl even cuter
                She drop down to her knees like 'I don't do this all the time'
                And that's when I reply
                Girl you know you lyin'
                I looked right in her eyes and said 'girl you know you fine'
                She said men think with they penis
                So I told her blow my mind
                That foreign car parked outside
                She know that shit is mine
                And a real ni-a, son, like me
                She know that's hard to find
                I pulled up, I'm turnt up
                No, I don't wait on no line
                That Jesus piece, that cuban link
                Versace shades on my eyes
                Now I know how B.I.G. felt
                I'm strapped boy, no seat belt
                You a bitch n***a, yeah a female
                I'm a G male, no E-mail
                Still got that comeback
                Wholesale and retail
                I'm riding on that money train
                And I don't wanna be derailed
                I don't pop them mollies
                But I know that she will
                I'm high up, that weed smell
                And that codeine got me ill
                45 on my hip, 45 on my wrist
                2 45 for my whip, now that's what I call lick
                Vegas night roulette table, lost 45 in one spin
                I'm a harlem n***a, I double duck, bet 45 again
                Lost that, made it right back, in a 45 minute trip
                N***a wanted to and I fronted 2, charging 45 each brick
                N***a you road boat, and I'm show boat
                And you're joe rogan, I'm hulk hogan
                My car foreign, next season
                You jet skiing, my jet leaving
                And I brought your girl with me
                She a zombie, she be head eating
                Wanna see a movie come see me
                Fuck hd, I'm 3d
                What I smoke be 1 hunned
                And I'm 300 like chief keef
                Screaming oh I, bang, bang, you know the drill
                Overkill
            </p>

            <p>
                Fly up, or get flown over
                Swag up, or get swagged on
                Boss up or get bossed around
                We don't cuff hoes, they get passed on
                Bad bitches, I got that
                Big money, I got that
                Four doors, coupe ? , top back, I got that
                Still keep that big thing and that thing'll blow your top back
                Who said they gon' take something? We right here, they ain't take nothing
                Fall back or get flat lined
                Red beam on that black nine
                Cold steel with these hot shells, you talk shit and I back mine
