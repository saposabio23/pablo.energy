            <p>
                <span>[Intro: Eugene McDaniels]</span>
                They landed at Plymouth
                With a smile on their face
            </p>

                My whole disposition like fuck who told me to sit
                Ten toes on the cement, lil weed in my socks
                Sin - do songs to repent, clean up my thoughts
                We in a box, see a lot of niggas talk on the bench
                A lotta father figures followin' trends, I ain't involved with 'em
                Lemmings like to fall off of cliffs and bring they squad with 'em
                I seen God in the mirror drinking, I tee off when the spirit hit me
                And I don't fear the ending, I feel the envy
                I listen to my past when it whisper to me
                Half of it makes sense, my nigga half of it riddles to me
                Moses with a makeshift staff sending ripples through ya
                And through the land, and the river been a plan
                But when I go to grab it, it slither out my hand
                So on my other hand, I been handling business
                Kinda shabby but my momma told me "Man up, my nigga"
                And now I'm Popeye with the anchor tats and the spinach
                Finna spazz on a nigga if I have to
                Risk takers know Satan knew dance moves
                It could be your last move
                Hard to see the glass half full, when you don't have food
                Wrist dangling like black fruit, nigga
            </p>

                Crossing all my T's
                And I'm dotting all my I's
                Gotta watch out for debris
                When it's fallin' down
                As far as I can see
                I done confronted all the shit
                I couldn't walk around
                Keep a piece when you on the ground
                Leakin', you hard as Hell
                Keep some wind in my sails
                Walkin' down La Brea
                Name ringin' bells like we got some mail
            </p>
